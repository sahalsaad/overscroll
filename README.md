# Overscroll JS

**What it does**: Overscroll detects when a user using Apple's touchpad feature (Macbook Touchpad or Magic Touchpad) scrolls outside the bounds of the webpage, firing a callback in your application.
It's extremely lightweight, has no dependencies, and is less than 400 bytes when minified.

### Example:
```javascript
overscroll(() => 
	console.log('Overscroll Detected')
);
```
